# FalconX
This is the repository for solutions to the QA Assignment Set of FalconX.
The code in all the files has been tested thoroughly and hence, it shouldn't throw an error. However, coding gods work in mysterious ways. So, if an error is somehow encountered, please reach out to saiakshitk@gmail.com
Also, to run these files, a " %store " function is used to transfer variables from one file to another. This function works best if the files are downloaded and saved in the same directory.
